McEliece cryptosystem implementation by vovuas2003

Required Python libraries: numpy, galois.

All cryptosystem functions are implemented in cryptosystem_core.py, just import it into your project and enjoy!
For example, I coded a console menu (that works with txt files) and a GUI app.

It is possible to build portable exe with pyinstaller and run code on a computer that does not have Python installed.
But it is NOT compilation, so exe file will be quite large.

The pdf presentation in Russian contains a bit of theory about the Mceliece cryptosystem; icon.ico is an optional file for pyinstaller.
